    "With lecture 1 in the books, this one should be pretty simple and direct. The working hypothesis is that there is an equivalence relation between the way quantum mechanics is represented using a complex-valued vector space and quaternion series. Every calculation done the standard way in lecture 1 was done with quaternion series for the companion iPython notebook. Continue that process with Lecture 2 which fortunately is shorter. It is also simpler, focusing on spin, something that can be described as best we can do with two quantum states. Set up our math tools."

    "I am in the second class. My montra is that quantum mechanics as done today is formally exactly right, but it is not right enough. Most of the progress that needs to be done is in phase spaces that are not even written down. Instead of just the one Schrödinger equation, there are three mixed derivative differential equations that I can write down but do not understand how to use productively. That is for another Lecture. A new proposal I have for how gravity works, quaternion gravity, is based on terms that are not in the canonical lexicon of physics. That example however is not quantum mechanical other that to say if true, the graviton as a material expression of a gravity field does not exist. Instead, special relativity sets some precise rules about what equations can be used to describe Nature. Gravity imposes a different set of rules on all equations. I know these are huge claims not back up by supporting evidence here. Bottom line: things are great, and they can become greater, but it will require a crazy amount of work, hence these notebooks."

For a quaternion series, I just called that function for each quaternion in the series. That produced an incorrect value for the quaternion series.
