In a similar way, a quaternion series which is a totally-ordered array of quaternions with integers for rows and columns, will have a totally-ordered array of complex numbers as a subgroup. Perhaps the title question should be modified to ask about an $H^*$-algebra. My expectation is that there will be a few places where things will be different since a quaternion series is in a sense larger than a complex series."

I have read people far more skilled that I will ever be _argue_ over which of these is the right way to measure things with quaternions. Different input leads to different output, so neither is right or wrong. Instead, in certain situations, one sort of product will be the only one to use in that situation. Change the situation, change the need. For quantum mechanics, the need is for something I call the \"Euclidean product\" which always takes the conjugate of the first term before multiplying. The first sort of product, $A^2$, is useful for doing special relativity and my new approach to gravity (quaternion gravity)."

    "The issue may have to due with the focus on _the one number_. Neither $A^2$ nor $A^* A$ results in a solitary number. In both cases, the result is another quaternion, not one number. Yet I have seen professionals treat the value that comes out of $A^* A$ as real number, not a quaternion. This strikes me as wrong. Much of what gets studied in physics is the neighborhood of points. The neighborhood of real number is fundamentally different from the neighborhood of a quaternion. The only point near a real number are other real numbers. For a quaternion, the neighborhood is full of points from time and three dimensions of space, all with specific algebraic relationship to each other.\n",

    "There are two different reasons why the norm squared, $A^* A$, has zero for all three imaginaries. The first is that the sine of the angle between $A$ and $A^*$ is zero. There is no cross product for a quaternion and its conjugate. The same can be said for $A^2$. The scalar times the vector add constructively for $A^2$ but destructively for $A^* A$. No cross product and the canceling of terms are the two reasons for the three zeroes of the norm squared. This feels like a deeper way to look at what is going on."
