    "Since this is an experiment in progress, I am never sure whether I will find a way to do everything using quaternion series quantum mechanics. Some things will be killer easy: unitarity is just another name for having a norm of one. My biggest worry or mystery is how to handle the imaginary factor $i$. Quaternions have the built in $i$, $j$, and $k$. That presents two different issues: one that there are three, and two they don't commute. One of the deep lessons of quantum mechanics is that many of the calculations that are done don't give a darn about what direction in space a state is pointed in because we will be calculating $A^*A$ which removes direction. Not commuting is required in certain situations. Will have to see if the hurdles ahead can be cleared.\n",

Using quaternion tools and quaternions of the form $(a, b, 0, 0)$, one must necessariy get the standard results for quantum mechanics done on a complex-valued Hilber space. There can be no exceptions here since complex numbers are a subgroup of quaternions. Then the question is how going to a full quaternion will tweak an expression.\n",

    "The quaternion series approach has to take a different approach to get to the same result. In the standard method, the factor $i$ communtes with all. With quaternions, there are three possible imaginary terms, $i$, $j$, and $k$. My nomenclature is to use a capital $I$ to indicate a impaginary term that points who-knows-where. An essential property is big $I$ has a norm of one (which is a little unfortunate since it looks **exactly** like the symbol for an identity matrix). For any particular quaternion, there will be a specific big $I$. The factors of big $I$ for two randomly chosen quaternions probably do not commute. In quantum mechanics, to get to observables one would calculate $I^* I$ which has the same value of unity no matter which way it points.\n",

It is a good, logically consistent system. What I am doing is making a different choice about the phase. The phase does not matter. Yet my choice leads to a different sign convention. Making things simpler. There are no factors of $i$ because all terms whether potentials, source, states, operators, etc., necessarily have a big $I$.\n",

I am never going to have the math chops to prove this speculation. I know when they were shopping for a group that was needed to complete the standard model, it had to have eight members and each one had to have a norm of one. The $S$ in $SU(3)$ means special, having a norm of one. The number of memember is the Lie algebra is $3^2 -1 = 8$. I will probably never know if there is any other quality needed for the strong force gauge symmetry (OK, non-commuting). The quaternion group $Q_8$ has both of those qualities."

    "I suffer from \"Minkowski vision\". No matter how much I admire the authors of this book, talking about \"time\" bothers me. It should always be space-time because a different observer will take a pure time measurement and need to use one of space-time. The fact that the wave function changes in space-time sounds more reasonable to my ear. Of course the wave function has different values in space-time (particularly the space part, but that always carries over into the time part too). I would have written it as $$<\\Psi(Rt)|\\textbf{L}|\\Psi(Rt)>.$$ This alteration changes no calculation in a material way. It is only about ontology, why things are the way they are. Every state of a wave function lives in space-time and only space-time, never just time alone. Respect that insight. For classical quantum mechanics, the changes that happen in time far exceed those in space, hence the standard approach is reasonable."

When quaternions point in the same direction, then the cross product - expressed as $|A||B| \\sin(\\theta)$ - is zero. The second type of cancelation requires necessarily the conjugate operator to wipe out the symmetric terms. Using a conjugate means that the complete system is **necessarily non-local**. "
