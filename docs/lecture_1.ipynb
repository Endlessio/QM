    "## The quaternion series for quantum mechanics hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is being created as a companion to the book \"Quantum Mechanics: the Theoretical Minimum\" by Susskind and Friedman (QM:TTM for short). Those authors of course never use quaternions as they are a bit player in the crowded field of mathematical tools. Nature has used one accounting system since the beginning of space-time. I will be a jerk in the name of consistency. This leads to a different perspective on what makes an equation quantum mechanical. If a conjugate operator is used, then the expression is about quantum mechanics. It is odd to have such a brief assertion given the complexity of the subject, but that makes the hypothesis fun - and testable by seeing if anything in the book cannot be done with quaternions and their conjugates. Import the tools to work with quaternions in this notebook, the most important one being Q_tools that was tailored for the task at hand."

    "Here is my first substantive disagreement, not so much with Susskind as with the traditional explanation as created in the early 1800s by C. Wessel and Argand. This graph can be written in books, published, and studied. It is both useful and good. The common complaint is that there appears to be no difference between the real axis and the imaginary one. Consider the following experiment. Someone draws a point in the complex plane and does either a reflection over the real or imaginary axis. They cover up the label for both axes. In this math thought experiment, there would be no way to distinguish if the reflection had been over the real or the imaginary axis. To an experimental mathematician, this means there is a problem with the definition of real versus imaginary numbers. Most mathematicians project a faith in defined logical precision. If something is define precisely and the logic works, there is no need for discussion and nothing is wrong.\n",

    "The deeper math idea that is hinted at is that we are all taught about representing complex numbers on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Much of complex analysis relies on working with complex numbers on the manifold $\\mathbb{C}^1$. Everything that can be done on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can also be done on $\\mathbb{C}^1$ so long as one has both $z$ and $z^*$. When I learned this lesson, it immediately sounded like a problem for quaternions. This time there will be functions on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ that cannot be constructed using just $q$ and $q^*$. I considered this a show stopper - at least until I found a cute solution. I call them the first and second conjugates. Take a moment to calculate $(i q i)^*$ and $(j q j)^*$. You will see that those flip the signs on all the terms except the $i$ and $j$ respectively. So $q$, $q^*$, $q^{*1}$, and $q^{*2}$ are enough on the quaternion manifold $\\mathbb{H}^1$ to cover all possible functions one can construct on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Again, this digression is not germane to the case of just one imaginary factor. I point it out to say more than one can be handled, and it will be darn interesting to see how it plays out technically."

Yet I want to grant states more power and versatility (addition, addition's inverse subtraction, and multiplication by a scalar). The additional power is to drop the \"by a scalar\" clause, and put in is place \"and multiplication's inverse division.\" At one level, it does not sound like a big deal. Take the number 6, we can write four expressions using the two operators and their inverses: $2 + 4 = 6$, $6 + (-4) = 2$, $2 * 3 = 6$, $6 * 3^{-1} = 2$.

The real and complex numbers commute under both addition and multiplication, not so quaternion products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector space V, {V, +} is a group due to the work shown above, specifically 1, 3-5. No effort is expended to show the same is true for multiplicaiton because while a ket of exactly the same length can be added to another ket to generate a third ket, the same is not true by the rules of matrix multiplication. The number of rows never equal the number of columns, case closed.\n",

    "For quaternion series, the rules for multication are modified in a specific way. If one has a ket of the same dimension, then to form a sensible product, the ket on the left is diagonalized first to form a square matrix. At this point, the rules of matrix multiplication allow a product to be formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this concrete. Consider a real-valued vector with three state dimensions, $|1 \\;2 \\;3>$. If we squared each term individual, $|k^2>$, the result is $|1\\; 4\\; 9>$. If the left ket is made into a diagonal operator with a state dimension of 3 rows by 3 columns, one can form a product with the ket with three rows and a column, so $\\rm{diagonal}(k) \\times |k> = |1\\; 4\\; 9>$. Recall how addition of two vectors happens if and only if they are of the same dimensions. This is also the case for multiplicaiton. A similar story is possible for bras, but this time it is the left bra that gets made into a diagonal operator. The result of the multiplaciton is other bra quaternion series of the same dimension.\n",
