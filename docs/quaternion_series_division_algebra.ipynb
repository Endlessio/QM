    "I am studying quaternion series, hoping to apply them to quantum mechanics. It would be wrong to think of a quaternion series as a set of Quaternions. A set can be permuted and it is still the same set. A quaternion series is a totally ordered (possibly infinite) array. Each series has associated with it two integers called rows and columns. The product of the rows and columns must equal the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested by the naming of rows and columns, there is much overlap between quaternion series and standard matrix algebra. The one difference will be in how products can be formed between series with the same values for rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am calling each element in the array a state. Each state is a Quaternion in the full sense of the word as far as the addition and multiplication operators are concerned. Each state can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided by a state in the same position in the quaternion series.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a division algebra, both the addition and multiplication operators must be shown to be group operators for quaternion series. Part of the motivaction is to treat the two operations - addition and multiplication - in a similar way. Both are just functions that take in to inputs and create one output. Eliminate any bias in how the two are treated.\n",

That is a utilitarian critique (and a good one, I get it). But if one strives to really treat addition and multiplication similarly, a call to the function identity() should be able to return either the additive or multiplicative identity.

    "Quaternion series are not numbers like the real numbers, complex numbers and quaternions. Instead they start from quaternions and add more structure: the array, rows, and columns. Addition and multiplicaiton have been shown to be group operations on quaternion series, and thus this quaternion series are a division algebra. It is not obvious to me where there will turn out to be \"a good thing\". Yet my gut says this is better than just having addition as a group operation."
