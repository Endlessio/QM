# Quaternion Series QM companion to "Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum"

For the sake of logical consistency, can everything in quantum mechanics be
done with quaternions? This hypothesis will be tested in this repository.

Back in 1998, I wondered if everything that could be done in special relativity
could be done using only quaternions. To test that hypothesis, I audited a
course at MIT, 8.033, Classical and Relativisti Mechanics (now apparently
called "The Physics of Spacetime"). The test was that every assigned problem
set needed to be solved the standard way using vectors and the Lorentz group
and also had to be solved using only real-valued quaternions. If there was a
single problem that could not be solved using real-valued quaternions, then
the hypothesis was wrong. The 50+ problems are [available on the
web.](https://dougsweetser.github.io/SRQ/)

The book "Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum" (QMTTM) by Leonard Susskind and
Art Friedman is a great book on the topic. If you are reading this, go buy
all three books of the TTM series. In ten chapters, many of the core issues of
the intriguing subject are covered in light algebraic detail, meaning this is
not a graduate-level book but one that does not avoid equations.

Early on in my studies on the utility of doing physics with quaternions, I
found a list of about ten algebraic expressions that are true of Hilbert
spaces. I was able to show that what I call the quaternion Euclidean product, A\* B, 
is [true for quaternions too](https://dougsweetser.github.io/Q/QM/bracket_notation/).

Quantum mechanics is more than just a Hilbert space. I want to find out if
everything that is done in QMTTM can be done using quaternions. Let the tests
begin.
