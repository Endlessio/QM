Clarifying the material is not just for the audience, it will also help you.
It will also help me help you. It is not really clear to me what exactly your
hypothesis is.

Do you agree with the postulates of quantum mechanics, and are just trying to
come up with different mathematical representations? Or are you proposing some
of the quantum mechanical postulates are changed as well?

And how exactly do your "Quaternion series" differ from a quaternion valued
vector?  You seem to think your "Euclidean product" is defining a
multiplication on the set of these Quaternion series, but it is not.  Your
Euclidean product is actually an inner product. It maps two Quaternion series
to one quaternion, not two Quaternion series to another Quaternion series.
Yes, testing your hypotheses is good, but it also requires a lot of effort to
clearly lay out your hypothesis so it can be appropriately tested.

Your replacement for the vectors, "Quaternion series", cannot divide each other
either.  In your code, you are representing everything with collections of
floating point numbers which serve as approximate representation of Reals ...
so this is a real valued "algebra". As you know, there are only 4 real valued
division algebras.  Your Quaternion series are larger than Quaternions, and are
not Octonians. So it should be clear you do not have a new set of objects you
which allow: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

If that is too theoretical an argument, let's look at an example. If the
"Euclidean product" of two Quaternions series 'a' and 'b' is defined as: E =
<a,b> = sum (a*_i) b_i then that means for the following non-zero "Quaternion
series"

a = [ [1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0] ]
b = [ [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,0] ]

the Euclidean product is zero.  So you have non-zero elements that "multiply"
to zero. So there are not inverse elements and you cannot define a division.


> "My central thesis however is in place."

Please at least clarify your presentation so it is immediately clear what your
thesis *IS*.
* What (if any) changes are you making the postulates of quantum mechanics?
* Clarify and state your definitions up front. Don't be making them up as you
* go. Otherwise your hypothesis testing is not the "precisely defined quest"
* you claim it is.

An added benefit of clearly laying our your idea, is that I can probably check
a lot of the math for you.ï»¿
